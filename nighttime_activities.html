        <p>Want to experience nature at night? Join our Night Jungle Trekking! In this activity, we will trek through the jungle 
        in search of wildlife such as mouse deers, owls, snakes and different kinds of exotic insects. Some of the insects you 
        find might even be insects that glow in the dark. If you are lucky, you might even be able to encounter big wildlife such 
        as wild boars! During the night trekking, you will also hear many amusing noises that are produced by insects that only 
        come out at night. In combination with the river flow noises, you will be able to listen to a melody that is only unique 
        to this jungle!</p>

        <p>Now you might be wondering, isn’t that dangerous? Well fear not, as we have multiple jungle trekking experts 
        that are also experienced hunters that can share their expertises regarding the animals as well as ensure your safety. 
        To ensure that they are able to protect you well, you will be separated into groups of 4 to 5 people.</p>

        <p>Want a chilling experience for the night? Join our Firefly Viewing session! Contrary to popular belief, 
        firefly sightings are actually possible all year round in Malaysia! This activity 
        is for you if you want to enjoy a relaxing night soaking in the atmosphere and view of the 
        beautiful night jungle near our resort. You will be guided by our professional jungle trekking experts 
        that will bring you to our firefly viewing destination through the safest route available. Worry not, 
        as it is only a 15 minute walk to the firefly viewing area.</p>

        <p>At the viewing spot, there will be an open spot where you can remain in while taking in the 
        beautiful view of the clear sky combined with the breathtaking view of the fireflies. There will 
        also be professional photographers on the scene where you can request for a 
        high-quality picture to be taken under the night sky surrounded by fireflies. These pictures 
        will be available to you once you return to the resort for a small fee of RM5 per picture!</p>
